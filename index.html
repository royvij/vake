				<h2 class="page-title">Consuling Agreement</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Release and Indemnification</b><br />
					CLIENT hereby releases and agrees to hold harmless, defend and indemnify
					Consultant, from any and all claims, actions, proceedings, suits,
					liabilities, damages (actual, consequential, or incidental),
					settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses (including without
					limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and other litigation expenses) of
					every kind, whether known or unknown, incurred by CLIENT arising out of
					this Agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Limitation of Liability</b><br />
					In no event shall Consultant be liable for indirect, special or
					consequential damage suffered by CLIENT in connection, directly or
					indirectly, with the action or inaction of Consultant under or in
					relation to this Agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Liability for Data Loss</b><br />
					CLIENT understands that there are inherent risks in providing support to
					computer systems which include but are not limited to data loss, data
					corruption, or complete loss of files or directories. CLIENT agrees that
					Consultant will not be held liable for damages in the case of data loss.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Independent Contractor</b><br />
					Both CLIENT and Consultant agree that Consultant will act as an
					independent contractor in the performance of duties under this contract.
					Accordingly, Consultant shall be responsible for payment of all taxes
					including Federal and Provincial taxes arising out of Consultant’s
					activities in accordance with this contract. Nothing contained in this
					Agreement is intended to constitute the Parties as partners or joint
					venturers in the legal sense. Neither party intends that a partnership,
					joint venture or similar relationship be formed by this Agreement or any
					performance hereunder. Neither party shall have any express or implied
					right or authority to assume or create any obligations on behalf of, or
					in the name of, the other or to bind the other to any contract,
					agreement or undertaking with any third party.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Confidentiality</b><br />
					Each party agrees that the Confidential Information of the other party
					will be held in confidence to the same extent and the same manner as
					each party protects its own Confidential Information, but each party
					agrees that in no event will less than reasonable care be used. Each
					party shall, however, be permitted to disclose relevant aspects of such
					Confidential Information to its officers or employees on a need-to- know
					basis, provided they have undertaken to protect the Confidential
					Information to the same extent as required under this Agreement.
					“Confidential Information” means each party’s trade secrets, financial
					information, formulas, specifications, programs, instructions, technical
					know-how, methods of operation, testing benchmarks, any other
					information identified by a party as Confidential Information, and any
					other information that should reasonably be understood to be
					confidential or proprietary. The confidential Information referred to in
					this Section shall not apply in the following cases: If it was already
					known to the other party, if it was disclosed- without obligation to
					keep the information confidential, if it was publicly known or became
					publicly known through no-fault of the receiving party, if it was
					independently developed by the receiving party without use of the other
					party’ Confidential Information, or if it is required to be disclosed by
					a court of competent jurisdiction and in that case, the disclosing party
					shall be granted a reasonable opportunity to obtain a protective order.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</b><br />
					This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
					laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made regardless
					of the place of physical execution of the agreement within such state,
					without regard to its conflict of laws rules. CLIENT hereby irrevocably
					and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
					of Orange County, California in respect of any dispute under this
					agreement.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Entire Agreement</b><br />
					The terms set forth in this Agreement are intended by the Parties as a
					final, complete and exclusive expression of their agreement with respect
					to the Services contemplated by this Agreement and may not be
					contradicted, explained or supplemented by evidence of any prior
					agreement, any contemporaneous oral agreement, or any consistent
					additional terms. There are no restriction, promises, representations,
					warranties, covenants, or undertakings, other than those expressly set
					forth or referred to herein. This Agreement is not intended to confer
					upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
					hereunder.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Severability</b><br />
					Should any term or provision hereof be deemed invalid, void or
					unenforceable either in its entirety or in a particular application, the
					remainder of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and
					effect, and, if the subject term o provision is deemed to be invalid,
					void or unenforceable only with respect to a particular application,
					such term or provision shall remain in full force and effect with
					respect to all other applications.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Modifications</b><br />
					All modifications to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by all
					Parties.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Force Majeure</b><br />
					Consultant shall be excused from performance to the extent that
					performance is prevented, delayed, or obstructed by causes beyond
					Consultant’s reasonable control, including delays in performance by
					CLIENT, acts of Nature (fire, storm, floods, earthquakes, etc.) civil
					disturbances, disruption of telecommunications, power or essential
					services.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Assignment</b><br />
					Neither of the parties may sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose
					of any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any person
					without the express written consent of the other party, except that
					Consultant may, at its sole discretion, hire or sub-contract out
					portions or all of the services to be provided hereunder.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Claim Limitation</b><br />
					CLIENT agrees, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, that
					any claim or cause of action arising out of or relating to this
					Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action
					arose or be forever barred. If any party brings an action arising out of
					this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of
					reasonable attorney’s fees, and any court costs incurred in such action
					or proceeding, in addition to any other damages or relief awarded.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Consents and Waivers</b><br />
					Failure of any party at any time or times to require performance of any
					provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to
					enforce the same, unless the same is waived in writing. No waiver by a
					party of any condition or any breach of any term, covenant,
					representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be
					effective unless in writing, and no waiver of any one or more instances
					shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any such
					condition or breach in other instances.
